# CPP-HashMap

A C++ program that utilizes a hash map to store a document's word frequency.

Email is FALSE if the frequency of each word is equal to 1. Email is TRUE for every other case.
Additionally: The greeting line (“Dear _______”) is to be ignored when counting word frequency. Ignore periods, commas, exclamation marks, question marks, and quotations.

Each input file will represent your email inbox.
